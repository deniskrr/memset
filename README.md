# What is this?
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/fluxtah/memset/blob/master/gfx/screenshot-01.png" alt="Card Designer" />Memset (An abreviation of Memory Set) is a small WIP application to create memory cards (those cards with two sides where one side presents a problem and the other side the solution).  Memset is a working usage example of Jetpack Compose. It aims to follow the development of Jetpack Compose adopting best practice application design as well as ultimately provide a useful application for remembering stuff and a reference to those that are on the development journey that could do with a little help.

# A Modular Application
Memset is a modular application, it is divided into gradle modules along the most useful boundaries such as by Feature or API.

By splitting your app into modules it promotes reusability and eases parallel work streams. If you work in a large corporation with many developers who work on your product it is beneficial to ensure that parallel work can be carried out and having a modular approach to building applications can contribute toward this goal.
